The full analysis pipeline is written in `run_scripts.m`.

This repository only contains the final results presented in the StabilityCCA paper. To re-run any part of the analysis, first download and pre-process the data by running `download_data` and `process_data`. NB: some parts of the analysis will take a long time to run and a computing cluster is recommended.

For simple examples on how to use StabilityCCA, see the main README.
